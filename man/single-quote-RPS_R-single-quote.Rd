\title{Resistant Procrustes Superposition Package in R (RPS_R):
a novel package for landmark-based resistant shape analysis}
\usage{
robgit_RPS(X, consenso = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A s-dimensional array of n x k matrices (k configurations of n landmarks), each representing the shape of an object}

\item{consenso}{A logical value that determines if the consensus configuration is returned.}
}
\value{
s-dimensional array of n x k matrices, representing the (resistant) superimposed objects
}

Description
-----------
Geometric morphometrics uses landmarks coordinates to
extract shape information, and shape differences between objects or individuals
are analyzed by performing a Procrustes superposition of the corresponding
configurations of landmarks.
Which superposition criterion should be used is always a central issue;
typically, the least squares (LS) Procrustes superposition is chosen. This method
minimizes the sum of squared distances across landmarks, but it is widely accepted
that the result can be misleading whenever shape differences are located in less
than 50% of thelandmarks.
A resistant Procrustes superposition is probably the most
elegant and efficient alternative. It perfectly superimposes those landmarks
exhibiting no variation in case they are more than 50%. Despite this appealing
and rather intuitive feature, the resistant approach is seldom used probably due
to the lack of a free & friendly software implementation.
Hence, this R-package specifically implements an a set of descriptive tools
following Torcida et. al (2014*)
to perform a resistant shape analysis of 2D and 3D configurations of landmarks.
The RPS_R package includes:
 *a generalized resistant Procrustes superposition (robgitRPS.R)
 *a resistant distance to quantify the resulting shape differences (distanciaR.R), and
 *a resistant Multidimensional Scaling to produce an ordination (univMDSrobust.R)
The corresponding LS counterparts of the previous functions have also been
implemented (procrustesCM.R, distanciaCM.R and univMDSeucl.R, respectively), to
offer a rather complete set of descriptive tools and to enable the comparison
of LS and resistant approaches if applied to the same dataset.
