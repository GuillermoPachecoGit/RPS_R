Description: This package offers a set of tools to perform a rather complete descriptive
             landmark-based resistant shape analysis 3D and 2D, following
             Torcida et al. 2014 ("An integrated approach for landmark-based resistant
             shape analysis in 3D", Evol. Biol. 41(2):351-366). 
             More specifically, these tools enable to obtain:
              *a generalized resistant Procrustes superposition (robgit_RPS.R) 
              for a set of configurations of landmarks either in 3D and 2D
              *a resistant distance (resdistance_RPS.R) to quantify shape differences
              obtained following the resistant Procrustes superimposition, and
              *a resistant ordination (resunivMDS_RPS.R) of the superimposed configurations
              based on the universal Multidimensional Scaling from (Agarwal et al. 2010)   
             The corresponding Least-squares counterparts of all these tools (procrustesCM_RPS.R,
             cmdistance_RPS.R and eucunivMDS_RPS.R, respectively) have also been implemented
             in RPS_R to offer a more complete set of shape analysis descriptive
             tools. This enables the comparison of the LS and resistant superimposition
             results when applied to the same dataset.
             The RPS_R package also includes a rather new method for a resistant analysis
             of individual shape asymmetry for configurations of landmarks in 2D with bilateral
             symmetry (matching or object symmetry), following Torcida et al. 2016 ("A resistant
             method for landmark-based analysis of individual asymmetry in two dimensions",
             Quant. Biol. 4(4):270-282). The main tools enable to estimate:
             *the resistant symmetric shape under matching symmetry (matchingsymm_RPS.R),
             including a plot of the results and the table of landmarks' contributions to asymmetry
             *a resistant symmetric shape estimation under object symmetry (objectsymm_RPS.R),
             including a plot of the results and the table of landmarks' contributions to asymmetryobject_symm.R functions that follow (Torcida et al. 2016).
